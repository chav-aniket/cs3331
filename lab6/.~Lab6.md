## Exercise 1: Setting up NS2 simulation for measuring TCP throughput

### Question 1

*Why the throughput achieved by flow tcp2 is higher than tcp1 between time span 6 sec to 8 sec?*

n3 --> n2 --> n4 --> n5 has one transmissions with 2.5Mbps bottleneck between n2 --> n4 while n0 --> n1 --> n2 --> n4 --> n5 has two transmissions with the 2.5Mbps bottleneck between n1 --> n2 --> n4. 

### Question 2

*Why the throughput for flow tcp1 is fluctuating between time span 0.5 sec to 2 sec?*



### Question 3

*Why is the maximum throughput achieved by any one flow capped at around 1.5Mbps?*



## Exercise 2: Understanding IP Fragmentation

### Question 1

*Which data size has caused fragmentation and why? Which host/router has fragmented the original datagram? How many fragments have been created when data size is specified as 2000?*



### Question 2

*Did the reply from the destination 8.8.8.8. for 3500-byte data size also get fragmented? Why and why not?*



### Question 3

*Give the ID, length, flag and offset values for all the fragments of the first packet sent by 192.168.1.103 with data size of 3500 bytes?*



### Question 4

*Has fragmentation of fragments occurred when data of size 3500 bytes has been used? Why and why not?*



### Question 5

*What will happen if for our example one fragment of the original datagram from 192.168.1.103 is lost?*



## Exercise 3: Understanding the Impact of Network Dynamics on Routing

### Question 1

*Which nodes communicate with which other nodes? Which route do the packets follow? Does it change over time?*



### Question 2

*What happens at time 1.0 and at time 1.2? Does the route between the communicating nodes change as a result of that?*



### Question 3

*Did you observe any additional traffic as compared to Step 3 above? How does the network react to the changes that take place at time 1.0 and time 1.2 now?*



### Question 4

*How does this change affect the routing? Explain why.*



### Question 5

*Describe what happens and deduce the effect of the line you just uncommented.*
